	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the issues involved in designing battery systems and power-transfer (charging) techniques for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ({AUVs}) operating within an Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network ({AOSN}). We focus on three different aspects of the problem, battery chemistry, pack management and in situ charging. We look at a number of choices for battery chemistry and evaluate these based on the requirements of maximizing power density and low temperature operation particular to {AUVs}. We look at the issues involved in combining individual cells into large battery packs and at the problems associated with battery monitoring, and the charging and discharging of packs in a typical {AUV} application. Finally, we present a methodology for charging an {AUV} battery pack in situ in support of long term deployments at remote sites.},

	abstract = {The Kalman filter variants extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) and error-state Kalman filter ({ESKF}) are widely used in underwater multi-sensor fusion applications for localization and navigation. Since these filters are designed by employing first-order Taylor series approximation in the error covariance matrix, they result in a decrease in estimation accuracy under high nonlinearity. In order to address this problem, we proposed a novel multi-sensor fusion algorithm for underwater vehicle localization that improves state estimation by augmentation of the radial basis function ({RBF}) neural network with {ESKF}. In the proposed algorithm, the {RBF} neural network is utilized to compensate the lack of {ESKF} performance by improving the innovation error term. The weights and centers of the {RBF} neural network are designed by minimizing the estimation mean square error ({MSE}) using the steepest descent optimization approach. To test the performance, the proposed {RBF}-augmented {ESKF} multi-sensor fusion was compared with the conventional {ESKF} under three different realistic scenarios using Monte Carlo simulations. We found that our proposed method provides better navigation and localization results despite high nonlinearity, modeling uncertainty, and external disturbances.},
